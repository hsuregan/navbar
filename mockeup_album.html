Is a garage punk album.  But theres definitive form here; its intentionally crude.  Now, Im no expert in garage punk, but the tracks on Badillac specifically give the impression of being live recordings.  Badillac seems composed deconstructively as a jumble of emotional angst, and subsequently recomposed constructively as a collection of songs united by something we can all relate to at some point(s) in our lives--unrequited feelings for someone.  Each track seems composed in a process of great effort and experiential struggle, yet with such a sense of brevity that even a rail of your late night yayo on a Friday could probably outlast the process.  Indeed, many tracks seemed as if they were pumped out late at night after one too many, and a subsequent boost.  But after the booze and the drugs wear off, after deconstruction, all the songs remain animated by a furiously continuous source of inspiration: a girl on his mind.  William Keegans mind that is, vocals for together Pangea.  Especially tracks like Make Myself True and Depress, wherein element of messiness and scruff really take form to masquerade some raw feelings.   together Pangea wears their heart on their sleeve, and they definitely make that loud--quite literally--and clear in all of Badillacs tracks, even in the slower songs in the album like No Way Out and Why, which are just blunt testaments.   But the band attempts to appear like badasses doing so with instrumental and lyrical juxtapositions, in which their go to method are sad topic matter--girl, emotions, feelings, yes, yep, yuup--and seething instrumental brute.  Though there are always exceptions, and this occurs with Rivers, a beamy track that resonates with a different tone than the rest of the album.  Seeming almost out of place, Rivers is a song you could imagine playing in a shitty American Pie movie or off a Blink-182 album, which is fun every once in a while to reminisce to; a gem that wasnt quite sieved out in the process of composing Badillac.  When its all said and done, together Pangea casts Badillac nonchalantly into the audience.   Though they appear like they could give two shits at times with overbearingly irate instrumentals, they do give shits, Sick Shits in fact-- My heart is lost/these things mean nothing to me/my dick is soft/these things mean nothing to me/not to me, Keegan declares this clause in Sick Shit whiningly.</div>
